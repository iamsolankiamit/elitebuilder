**EliteBuilders – AI Builders Competition Platform**

---

## 1. The Problem

AI-centric companies—and even many non-tech enterprises—need proof that candidates can ship **real, product-ready AI solutions**, not just crack algorithm puzzles.

* Current coding-challenge sites (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) test algorithmic skill but ignore end-to-end product thinking: prompt design, UX flow, data handling, business framing.
* Self-taught builders lack a credible, holistic showcase that translates into job offers.
* Result: long hiring cycles, mismatched hires, and hidden talent.

## 2. The Solution

Launch a **web-based competitive arena** where solo builders rapidly craft and submit AI-powered MVPs—complete with a prototype, pitch deck, and demo video—against company-authored or sponsored challenges.

* **Automated LLM-driven scoring** + human judge reviews = hybrid leaderboards that surface top talent.
* Hiring partners gain early access to ranked submissions and can directly engage winners.
* Participants earn badges, cash prizes, and bragging rights that convert into jobs or freelance gigs.
